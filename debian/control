Description: Implements API to brige ZigBee, INSTEON and X10 networks
 The ZBPServer software is Linux "middleware" that allows
 implementation and management of multiple automation networks. The
 server bridges the lower level (physical) interfaces to ZigBee,
 INSTEON and X10 networks, with the higher level user applications that
 are typically implemented as web, mobile or desktop clients. ZBPServer
 abstracts the physical differences of the various automation protocols
 into logical objects that simplify the client applications. By
 handling all aspects of monitoring and control of nodes, network
 management, automation event handling and scenes creation and
 management, the ZBPServer lets the client application concentrate on
 the graphical user interface.
